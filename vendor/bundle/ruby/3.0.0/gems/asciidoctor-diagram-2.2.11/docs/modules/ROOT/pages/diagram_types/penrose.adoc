{uri-penrose}[Penrose] is a platform that enables people to create beautiful diagrams just by typing notation in plain text.

Penrose diagrams consist of three parts:

- .domain file that defines the language specific to the domain.
- .substance file that creates substances of mathematical content.
- .style file that specifies the style of the visual representation.

The domain and style files are specified using attributes.
The substance of the diagram is the block contents.
